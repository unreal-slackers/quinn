## About
Quinn helps our moderators manage the Discord server. In other words: she’s the mannequin you don’t want to hear from. If you do, you’re probably in trouble.

## Help us improve
If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/quinn/issues) to see if someone already mentioned it. If you don't see it, [open a new issue](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/quinn/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing code, please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/quinn/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Can I invite Quinn to my server?
No. Quinn is not hosted publicly or designed to work with multiple servers. The main reason the code is open source is to provide the Unreal Slackers community with an opportunity to see how the bot works and contribute directly if they’re interested.

Hosting your own copy of the bot is not supported. If you decide to adapt any of the code for your own purposes, please respect the [license](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/quinn/blob/main/LICENSE).
